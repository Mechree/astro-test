# TASK-MATS

TASK-MATS is the combination of Artificial Intelligence with Semantic Technologies to command a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for task completion. The intended outcome of this project is to create an AI Overseer that has the ability to comprehend its environment, continuously learn, orchestrate a team of Agents to complete tasks, and verify that those tasks have been completed successfully. The benefits of this would result in an advanced and adaptable reasoning MAS that could be applied in various domain spaces, beginning with manufacturing.
